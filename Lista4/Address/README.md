<h1> Address</h1>
Create a class called "Address" which consists of the following fields:
<ul>
<li>String street - cannot be null</li>
<li>String houseNumber - must consist of numbers and possibly letters (e.g. 8c)</li>
<li>String postalCode - must have the format CC-CCC (C is a digit)</li>
<li>String city - cannot be null</li>
</ul>
Create a parametric constructor and getters and setters. Secure the class against invalid field values. Report invalid values through appropriate exceptions with a customized error message.<br>
Hint: use regular expressions.
