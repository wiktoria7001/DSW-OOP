Transport Company

DSW Transport Company is engaged in international freight forwarding. The company handles both sea freight shipping with container ships, railway transport and trucking. Transport is only done using containers. Prepare a program that can manage the described company.

Class structure

The program should consist of the following classes:
• Transport (abstract class) common to all forms of transport, includes methods:
– transport(from, to) - transports goods from place A to place B (displays the appropriate message of the transport being made, additionally when this method is called, a message about the form of transport should be displayed, e.g. transported by ship (this functionality should rather be implemented in child classes)
– load(...) method allows loading of goods.
• Goods - a class representing goods, includes necessary fields and methods
• Container - a class representing a container, includes a field storing an object of the Goods class, includes methods for loading and unloading goods.
• Ship, Train, Truck - classes inheriting from the Transport class, extending its methods and implementing methods specific to the given means of transport. Define the capacity of each transport: ship - 90 containers, train - 20 containers, truck - 1 container
• Warehouse - class that stores containers that are waiting for further transport
Additional classes may be implemented if necessary.

System simulation

In the class handling the simulation, propose structures that allow storing goods, containers and various means of transport. Perform a simulation consisting of the following steps:

1.Add products: electronic parts, mobile phones, shoes, clothing
2.Add 40 containers to the company's resources
3.Add 1 ship, 2 trains, and 10 trucks to the company's resources. Use a map (HashMap) for this purpose, whose keys are the names of the means of transport, and the values are lists containing specific objects
4.Define the company's warehouses: Gdańsk, Wrocław, Kraków, Poznań
5.Load into containers:
• 10 containers with electronic parts
• 20 containers with phones
• 5 containers each with shoes and clothing
6.Load all containers on the ship sailing from New York to Gdańsk
7.Unload the ship
8.Load the containers on trains heading to Wrocław. As the trains arrive in Wrocław, unload them and display the warehouse status
9.Transport all shoes and clothing to Poznań by truck (remember to unload to the warehouse)
10.Transport all electronic items to Kraków by truck
11.Tell how many total trips all the means of transport owned by the company have made (use a static field of the class for this purpose)

Notice: At the beginning of the simulation, all transportation vehicles are located in the warehouse in Gdańsk. It is possible that a situation arises where it is necessary to travel "empty," that is, without loaded goods (remember about load limitations).
