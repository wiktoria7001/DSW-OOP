<h1> Animal </h1>
Create an abstract class called "Animal" containing:
<ul>
<li>a private field called "species" with getter and setter</li>

<li>a parametric constructor</li>
</ul>
Two classes inheriting from the Animal class: "Mammals", "Birds". For these classes, create a parametric constructor that calls the base class constructor.<br>
Create a generic class called "Enclosure"<>, which will contain a private field that is a list of animals in the enclosure. Only animals of the same subclass (either mammals or birds) can be in the enclosure at the same time. Add methods that allow for adding and removing animals from the enclosure, and displaying the number of animals.
