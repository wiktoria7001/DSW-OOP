Create a generic class "Pair" that allows storing two values (objects) of the same type. The class should contain:

• two private fields "left" and "right" with getters and setters

• a parametric constructor that sets the values of the "left" and "right" fields

• a "swap" method that is used to swap the fields' places

• a "toString" method that creates a text representation of the object Tasks to be performed

Check the class's operation for pairs of integers, pairs of floating-point numbers, and pairs of text. (creation, display, value change, and re-display) Add a "max()" method to the class that returns the larger of the values (you can use the "compareTo" method for comparison).

Note: After adding this method, it will be necessary to limit the possible data types that the class can store. Test the method for selected three classes of objects.
