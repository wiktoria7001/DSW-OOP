<h1>Pair</h1>

Create a generic class "Pair" that allows storing two values (objects) of the same type. The class should contain:
<ul>
<li>two private fields "left" and "right" with getters and setters</li>

<li>a parametric constructor that sets the values of the "left" and "right" fields</li>

<li>a "swap" method that is used to swap the fields' places</li>

<li>a "toString" method that creates a text representation of the object Tasks to be performed</li>
</ul>
Check the class's operation for pairs of integers, pairs of floating-point numbers, and pairs of text. (creation, display, value change, and re-display).
Add a "max()" method to the class that returns the larger of the values (you can use the "compareTo" method for comparison).

Note: After adding this method, it will be necessary to limit the possible data types that the class can store. Test the method for selected three classes of objects.
